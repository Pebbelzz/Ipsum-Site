              <p>Kramer: Hey, you know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables. George [about a massage]: I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. Feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. Elaine: I think he's got ideas. Jerry: I wonder if any woman every said that about Einstein. Kramer: Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out. Elaine: Is this going to hurt? Doctor: Yes, very much. George: I'm a great quitter. I come from a long line of quitters. I was raised to give up. Mr. Peterman [in Burma]: So did you have any trouble finding the place. Jerry: She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs. Kenny Banya [reading]: Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine.</p>

              <p>Jerry: You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle. Jerry: I like the button fly. That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. George: That’s a lot of pressure. ‘Make love to me.’ What am I, in the circus? George: If it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books. George: Yeah, well, the jerk store called, they're running out of you. George: Is it my imagination, or do really good-looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else. Kramer: Your Nana's missing 'cause she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.</p>
