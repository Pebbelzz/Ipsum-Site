              <p>It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Don't you think she looks tired? I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room.</p>

              <p>Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Allons-y! Don't you think she looks tired? Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. I don't want to go. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.</p>

              <p>I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?</p>

              <p>I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Allons-y! Don't you think she looks tired?</p>
